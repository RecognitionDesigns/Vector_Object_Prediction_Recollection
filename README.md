# Vector_Object_Prediction_Recollection
Vector will predict what an object is in front of him, store the time, date, his position (for future use) and a picture of the object for later recollection.

You will need to install ImageAI modules

(link to be added)

Create folders 'pictures/predicted' in same directory as the scripts.
